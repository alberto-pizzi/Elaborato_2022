# Elaborato_2022

## Credits:
Some multimedia files (textures and audio) are downloaded from the internet. Others, however, are of my production.
The map was assembled entirely by me. The map tiles come from the web and have not been graphically modified.
The rest of the downloaded resources have been graphically adapted (by retouching or redrawing) according to the technical needs.
All downloaded resources have a free license.

The game is my design and production. It was written in C++11 with the SFML library.
