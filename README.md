# Elaborato Programmazione 2022

## Credits:

Some multimedia files (textures and audio) are downloaded from the internet. Others, however, are of my production. The
map was assembled entirely by me. The map tiles come from the web and have not been graphically modified. The rest of
the downloaded resources have been graphically adapted (by retouching or redrawing) according to the technical needs.
All downloaded resources have a free license. The game has been designed and developed by myself, using C++11 with the
SFML library.
